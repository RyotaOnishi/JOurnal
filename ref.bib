abstract = {{\textcopyright}2014 IEEE.Many studies have reported the usefulness of motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems. MI has been broadly characterized by the average of event-related changes of brain activity at specific frequency bands; but, temporal features of EEG have rarely been considered to identify different mental states of BCIs' users. Additionally, complex classification techniques may have been proposed to enhance the accuracy of system but they may cause a notable delay during online applications. This paper investigated the application of neural network-based algorithms to classify three-class MIs by utilizing EEG time-domain features. Integrated EEG (IEEG) and Root Mean Square (RMS) features were extracted from EEG signals. Then, Multilayer Perceptron and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks were employed to classify the features. The discrimination ratio of such features were examined and compared through different classifiers. Moreover, the robustness of classifiers was investigated and compared. The results of this study indicated that RMS was more capable than IEEG for characterizing MI movements and RBF was more accurate and faster than MLP. The effectiveness of IEEG and RMS features and the performance of MLP and RBF classifiers were compared with Willison Amplitude (WAMP) feature and support vector machine (SVM) classifier respectively. This study proved that WAMP and SVM were more efficient for classification of MI tasks in both terms of accuracy (88.96{\%}) and training time (0.5 second); however, considerable difference was not observed since RBF performed as fast as SVM with only about 3{\%} less accuracy.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 International League Against Epilepsy. Objective Absence seizures in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) may in part be explained by a decrease in phasic GABA A (type-A $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) receptor function, but the mechanisms are only partly understood. Here we studied the relation between ictal and interictal spike-wave discharges (SWDs) and electroencephalography (EEG) gamma oscillatory activity (30-60 Hz) in patients with IGE. Methods EEG recordings were obtained of 14 children with IGE (mean age, 8.5 ± 5 years) and 14 age- and sex-matched controls. Time-frequency analysis of each seizure and seizure-free control epochs was performed and cross-coherences of neocortical gamma oscillations were calculated to describe interictal and ictal characteristics of generalized seizures. Results SWDs were characterized with an abrupt increase of oscillatory activity of 3-4 and 13-60 Hz, peaking at 3-4 and 30-60 Hz, and with a simultaneous decrease in the 8-12 Hz frequency band. The rise in EEG gamma oscillations was short-lasting and decreased before activity declined at lower frequency ranges. Compared to control patients, patients with epilepsy also showed higher interictal values of mean coherence of gamma activity, but this interictal increase was not significant after post hoc analysis. Significance Our data support the hypothesis that gamma o scillatory activity increase concomitantly with rises in activity of lower EEG frequencies during absence seizures and that the activity starts to cease earlier than lower EEG frequencies. The data did not support a change in gamma activity preceding the 3-4 Hz SWDs. SWDs are hypothetically generated by the synchronous interaction between the thalamus and the cortex, whereas the production of gamma activity is the result of activity in local inhibitory networks. Thus, the modification of SWD by gamma activity may be understood in terms of the cellular and synaptic mechanisms involved.},

abstract = {Epileptic seizures are manifestations of epilepsy. Careful analyses of the electroencephalograph (EEG) records can provide valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. The detection of epileptiform discharges in the EEG is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. As EEG signals are non-stationary, the conventional method of frequency analysis is not highly successful in diagnostic classification. This paper deals with a novel method of analysis of EEG signals using wavelet transform and classification using artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR). Wavelet transform is particularly effective for representing various aspects of non-stationary signals such as trends, discontinuities and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. Through wavelet decomposition of the EEG records, transient features are accurately captured and localized in both time and frequency context. In epileptic seizure classification we used lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (LBDWT) as a preprocessing method to increase the computational speed. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational load of those algorithms that were based on classical wavelet transform (CWT). In this study, we introduce two fundamentally different approaches for designing classification models (classifiers) the traditional statistical method based on logistic regression and the emerging computationally powerful techniques based on ANN. Logistic regression as well as multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EEG signals. In these methods we used LBDWT coefficients of EEG signals as an input to classification system with two discrete outputs: epileptic seizure or non-epileptic seizure. By identifying features in the signal we want to provide an automatic system that will support a physician in the diagnosing process. By applying LBDWT in connection with MLPNN, we obtained novel and reliable classifier architecture. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The MLPNN based classifier outperformed the LR based counterpart. Within the same group, the MLPNN based classifier was more accurate than the LR based classifier. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The EEG Research Group at the University of Missouri has been interested in finding useful statistics with which to describe an EEG. In the past such calculations as the rms value of the wave, the autocorrelation function, etc., have been used to describe the process. It is convenient to use a stationary random process as a model for the EEG. Because the amplitude distribution of the EEG appears to be Gaussian, it has been suggested that a better model might be the normal stationary random process. This paper describes a test which was made to determine if the normal process is really a good model for the EEG.},

Methods: We identified characteristics of neonatal seizures by which a human observer is able to detect them. Neonatal seizures were divided into two types. For each type, a fully automated detection algorithm was developed based on the identified human observer characteristics. The first algorithm analyzes the correlation between high-energetic segments of the EEG. The second detects increases in low-frequency activity ({\textless}8 Hz) with high autocorrelation. Results: The complete algorithm was tested on multi-channel EEG recordings of 21 patients with and 5 patients without electrographic seizures, totaling 217 h of EEG. Sensitivity of the combined algorithms was found to be 88{\%}, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) 75{\%} and the false positive rate 0.66 per hour. Conclusions: Our approach to separate neonatal seizures into two types yields a high sensitivity combined with a good PPV and much lower false positive rate than previously published algorithms. Significance: The proposed algorithm significantly improves neonatal seizure detection and monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {Objective: This study was undertaken to identify the best performing quantitative EEG features for neonatal seizures detection from a test set of 21. Methods: Each feature was evaluated on 1-min, artefact-free segments of seizure and non-seizure neonatal EEG recordings. The potential utility of each feature for neonatal seizure detection was determined using receiver operating characteristic analysis and repeated measures t-tests. A performance estimate of the feature set was obtained using a cross-fold validation and combining all features together into a linear discriminant classifier model. Results: Significant differences between seizure and non-seizure segments were found in 19 features for 17 patients. The best performing features for this application were the RMS amplitude, the line length and the number of local maxima and minima. An estimate of the patient independent classifier performance yielded a sensitivity of 81.08{\%} and specificity of 82.23{\%}. Conclusions: The individual performances of 21 quantitative EEG features in detecting electrographic seizure in the neonate were compared and numerically quantified. Combining all features together into a classifier model led to superior performance than that provided by any individual feature taken alone. Significance: The results documented in this study may provide a reference for the optimum quantitative EEG features to use in developing and enhancing neonatal seizure detection algorithms. {\textcopyright}2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

Amongst the various disorder of the brain, epilepsy has drawn the most attention because this disorder can affect the quality of life of a person. In this paper we have reinvestigated the EEGs for normal and epileptic patients using surrogate analysis, probability distribution function and Hurst exponent. Results: Using random shuffled surrogate analysis, we have obtained some of the nonlinear features that was obtained by Andrzejak $\backslash$textit{\{}et al.{\}} [Phys Rev E 2001, 64:061907], for the epileptic patients during seizure. Probability distribution function shows that the activity of an epileptic brain is nongaussian in nature. Hurst exponent has been shown to be useful to characterize a normal and an epileptic brain and it shows that the epileptic brain is long term anticorrelated whereas, the normal brain is more or less stochastic. Among all the techniques, used here, Hurst exponent is found very useful for characterization different cases. Conclusions: In this article, differences in characteristics for normal subjects with eyes open and closed, epileptic subjects during seizure and seizure free intervals have been shown mainly using Hurst exponent. The H shows that the brain activity of a normal man is uncorrelated in nature whereas, epileptic brain activity shows long range anticorrelation.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a three-stage procedure based on artificial neural networks for the automatic detection of epileptiform events (EVs) in a multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. In the first stage, two discrete perceptrons fed by six features are used to classify EEG peaks into three subgroups: 1) definite epileptiform transients (ETs); 2) definite non-ETs; and 3) possible ETs and possible non-ETs. The pre-classification done in the first stage not only reduces the computation time but also increases the overall detection performance of the procedure. In the second stage, the peaks falling into the third group are aimed to be separated from each other by a nonlinear artificial neural network that would function as a postclassifier whose input is a vector of 41 consecutive sample values obtained from each peak. Different networks, i.e., a backpropagation multilayer perceptron and two radial basis function networks trained by a hybrid method and a support vector method, respectively, are constructed as the postclassifier and then compared in terms of their classification performances. In the third stage, multichannel information is integrated into the system for contributing to the process of identifying an EV by the electroencephalographers (EEGers). After the integration of multichannel information, the overall performance of the system is determined with respect to EVs. Visual evaluation, by two EEGers, of 19 channel EEG records of 10 epileptic patients showed that the best performance is obtained with a radial basis support vector machine providing an average sensitivity of 89.1{\%}, an average selectivity of 85.9{\%}, and a false detection rate (per hour) of 7.5.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of the ictal EEG event accompanying infantile spasms. Methods: Quantitative analysis was used, based on the application of a bivariate autoregressive (AR) parametric model; autospectra, coherence, phase functions and inter- hemispheric time differences were estimated on homologous EEG channels in 18 infants presenting with either cryptogenic or symptomatic West syndrome. Results: The AR analysis of the 500 ms EEG epochs preceding spasm onset revealed the presence of a short discharge of fast activity restricted to a narrow frequency band in 13 of the 18 cases included in the study. The fast discharge peaked at 17.5 ± 2.1 Hz, with rather low inter-hemispheric coherence values (0.52 ± 0.17) and asymmetric amplitude on homologous EEG derivations. It persisted briefly after spasm onset, reaching a higher coherence value (0.71 ± 0.16). The inter-hemispheric time difference, estimated in those cases with the coherence values significantly different from zero, ranged from 9.1 to 14.3 ms (11.4 ± 1.9) in the epoch preceding spasm onset. Conclusion: The data obtained from the analysis of the ictal EEG events, compared with clinical and interictal EEG features, indicate that an asymmetric EEG pattern (mainly consisting of a rhythmic burst of fast activity) consistently preceded both symmetric and asymmetric spasms, thus suggesting a localized cortical origin of the ictal discharge giving rise to the spasms.},
